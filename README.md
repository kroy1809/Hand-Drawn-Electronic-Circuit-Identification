# Hand-Drawn Electronic Circuit Identification
## Final year project for my undergraduate degree requirement

A modular algorithm in C for pattern recognition of circuits through syntactic & statistical methods (Law’s convolution, Haralick’s features, Run length encoding) to generate the corresponding PSpice code
